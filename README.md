# hello-world
Yet another one who doesn't have a clue what he is doing, which is not whithout ringing a bell...
The feeling is the same as my first years of medical training, noding to answer the teacher after the well-known terrible question "did you hear the heart murmur?"... "Well of course no, I was not even able to tell appart S1 from S2 sound..."
Now it's about the same when i am told to Create Pull Request and check if the new issue can be merged into the main branch after I comit changes in a temporary branch
